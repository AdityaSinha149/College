--what is a veiw
--A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
--A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
--You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

--can we do operations on veiw
--Yes, we can do operations on view. We can create a view from one or more tables and we can use the view as a table in the database. We can also perform operations like select, insert, update, delete on the view.

--19. Select all the courses from all_courses view. 
select * from all_courses;

--20. Create a view department_total_salary consisting of department name and total 
--salary of that department.
create view department_total_salary as
select dept_name,sum(salary) as total_salary
from instructor
group by dept_name;

--how to see all veiws/tables in sql plus
--To see all the tables in the database, you can use the following command in SQL*Plus:
--SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;
--To see all the views in the database, you can use the following command in SQL*Plus:
select view_name from user_views;
